ultrathink. This is not working properly. First of all only 1 terminal appear on start while they should all appear (I mean all     
  tabs should be open but with 1 terminal visible as before) in 1 pane. screenshot of issue : [Image #1]. Then here no matter if I    
  try to make another terminal visible it's going to be the same terminal shown all the time. Finally the tabs of the terminals are   
  still not draggable.
  Here is the exact summary of how I want it to work :
  Each pane has it's own terminal tabs. a terminal can only be in 1 pane at a time.
  starting a service will open it in the terminal viewer -> the first pane if no terminal are displayed yet, or in the latest used    
  pane if there are already existing panes (or a single one).
  Terminal tabs should be draggable from one pane to the other.
  A pane creation is simple, drag a pane and hold it a bit either in the right or left side of a pane and this will create a new      
  pane on that side.
  Enter plan mode to make sure the future edits will be ok.
